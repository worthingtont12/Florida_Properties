# Florida_Properties
Finding Trends amongst individual parcels in Florida 1995-2014.

# Data
The data contains information on all individual properties at the parcel level in Florida from 1995-2014. Each year is about 6GB and the total dataset is 90GB. The dataset contains all 67 counties and has information about the property's use and assessed value.

# Approach/Methodology
Our main question is what leads to a property either being sold above or below market value. Is it just the characteristics of the property or do other factors play a role? In order to identify these factors we will conduct a linear regression with the response variable being the difference between the assessed value of the property and the property's sale price.

# Purpose
This project is done as a final project for the Fall 2016 Data Mining Course. Although, results will be passed along to a local think tank in Tallahassee, Fl.

# Collaborators
Tyler Worthington , Lev Zadvinskiy, and Mark Rooney.
